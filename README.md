## Description
My Portfolio was a lot of fun designing and bringing to the web. It has some nice features, like it's a single page and dark mode/light mode. It hopefully displays me as a front-end developer with a set of skills, as well as a twinke in the eye and a portion of humor. See the key features for more details.

### Key features

- Single Page Site: This project has only one HTML file. Navigating between views is handled with JavaScript.
- Dark mode: The lights can be turned off from the circle in the header.
- Fresh design: I wanted to create something different that stands out from other portfolios.
- startViewTransition: A new experimental JavaScript method for smooth transitions. Browser support is good, otherwise, thats handled as well.
- Local storage: Both dark mode and active view are stored in local storage.
- Dynamic study progress: The study progress on the about view will change over time.
- Filtering projects: Projects can be filtered on all, school and private.
- Fun stuff: Thuggable thug sunglasses coming from the sky is fun!
- Responsive design: The website will look good on mobile and desktop.
